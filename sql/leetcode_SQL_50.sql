| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
user_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.
 

Table: Confirmations

| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
| action         | ENUM     |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
action is an ENUM (category) of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
 

The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.

Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.
Explanation

let's break down the SQL query block by block:

SELECT Clause:

It selects two columns: user_id from the Signups table (s alias), and the rounded average of a conditional expression aliased as confirmation_rate.
The conditional expression calculates a value of 1.00 if the action in the Confirmations table (c alias) is 'confirmed', and 0.00 otherwise.
FROM Clause:

It specifies the tables involved in the query: Signups table aliased as s.
LEFT JOIN:

It performs a left join between the Signups table and the Confirmations table (c alias).
The join condition is s.user_id = c.user_id, meaning it matches each signup with its corresponding confirmation, if any. If there's no corresponding confirmation, NULL values are returned for the columns from the Confirmations table.
GROUP BY Clause:

It groups the result set by user_id.
This grouping ensures that the average confirmation rate is calculated for each unique user.
AVG Function:

It calculates the average of the values returned by the CASE expression within each group.
This calculates the confirmation rate for each user by averaging the values of 1.00 (if confirmed) and 0.00 (if not confirmed).
ROUND Function:

It rounds the average confirmation rate to two decimal places for better readability.
Overall, the query efficiently calculates the confirmation rate for each user by leveraging conditional aggregation with the CASE statement, left joining signups with confirmations, and grouping the results by user_id.
